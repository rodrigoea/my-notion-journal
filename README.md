# My Notion Journal

This script automates the cleanup of a to-do list in [Notion](https://notion.so) by removing any checked "Done" items, including nested ones. This script is intended to be run daily to keep the list current and organized.

### ⚠️ Note

This project is a personal one that I'm refining in my free time. That means it may still have bugs and isn't perfect, so if you decide to use it, please keep in mind that some tweaks might be necessary. Feel free to report any bugs or make suggestions :)

## Features

- **Daily Cleanup**: Removes any completed ("Done") items from a specified Notion to-do list, including nested items.
- **Automation Ready**: Runs daily via GitHub Actions for continuous maintenance.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (recommended version 14+)
- A **Notion Integration** with access to your workspace and the relevant parent page ID.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a Notion Integration and Get Your API Key:**

   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations and create a new integration.
   - Save the **API Key** generated by Notion.

4. **Get the Parent Page ID:**

   - Open the Notion page you want to use as the parent in your browser.
   - Copy the ID from the URL after `notion.so/`, which should look like `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

     **p.s** If you created the integration as `internal`, make sure to connect it to the page by opening the three-dot menu at the top right → connections → click the integration name to connect.

5. **Create a `.env` File in the Root Directory:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Update the file with your API key and Parent Page ID.

   ```plaintext
   NOTION_API_KEY=placeholder
   PARENT_PAGE_ID=placeholder
   ```
